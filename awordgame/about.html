<p>
		In "A Word Game" you are presented with a psuedo-randomly generated
		string of characters <br> that you are expected to make words out
		of. <br> You enter your word in the text box at the top, and hit
		enter to submit. <br> If you get stuck, you can always press the
		(newly revamped) redraw button to get <br> a different string of
		characters. Your goal is to have more words than redraws. <br>
		<br> It's written in Java 8, so you'll need <a

		<br> in order to play.
