		What's "A Word Game"? A simple Scrabble-esque game for Windows, Mac,
		and Linux where you make <br> words out of a randomly generated
		string of characters. It's written in Java by Sgt. Pepper. <br> <br>You're
		going to need <a href="http://www.java.com/download">Java 8</a> to
		play it. Other than that, as long as you have a decent computer, you
		should be fine.
